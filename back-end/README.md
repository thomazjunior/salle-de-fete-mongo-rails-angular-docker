# Full-Stack Application for Event and Room Management

## Purpose
This project is a full-stack application designed to manage events, rooms, and books. It leverages Angular for the frontend, Rails for the backend, and Docker for containerization. SCSS is used for styling the frontend, providing a flexible and responsive user interface. This application aims to facilitate room and event management, making it easy for users to book rooms, manage event schedules, and keep track of bookings and resources. The system is designed for scalability, maintainability, and easy deployment.

## Technologies Involved

### Frontend:
- **Angular**: A robust framework for building dynamic, single-page web applications, providing a seamless user experience for managing rooms and bookings.
- **SCSS**: A preprocessor for CSS, allowing for more powerful styling techniques and easy customization of the frontend interface.

### Backend:
- **Rails**: A web application framework written in Ruby, used to build the backend for managing room schedules, events, and bookings. Rails provides an efficient structure for database management and API creation.

### Containerization:
- **Docker**: Used for creating containers that encapsulate both frontend and backend services, ensuring consistent development, testing, and production environments. Docker Compose is employed to manage multi-container setups.

## Project Features

- **Event Management**: Users can create, update, and manage events with details like time, location, and participants.
- **Room Booking**: The application allows for booking rooms for various events, keeping track of availability and scheduling conflicts.
- **User Interface**: Built using Angular, providing a modern, intuitive interface for users to interact with the system.
- **Responsive Design**: The frontend is styled using SCSS, offering a clean, mobile-friendly interface that adjusts well across different devices.
- **Scalability and Deployment**: With Docker, the application can be easily deployed and scaled across different environments.
